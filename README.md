Kookielibs
======

This is my personal collection of [KiCAD]() parts that I use in my projects. Some of these *may* be duplicates from the KiCAD standard lib but usually they aren't.

The sorting scheme is very *me* :)

 - Common parts are grouped by **function**
 - Esoteric parts are grouped by **manufacturer**
 
Sometimes esoteric chips will be grouped to a function if I have enough of them. For example:

**PSSI2021SAY ** is alone in the **NXP** category because it is the only part of it's function (constant current source)

On the other hand **FXL6408** and **XRA1220(P)** are grouped by function under **IOX** because I have a few of that type (and expect more!)

#### Submodules

Some parts are "stolen" from other libraries. These just get included as a top-level submodule. This is so that I can simply clone THIS repository and get all my common working parts.


#### Contributions

This is my personal collection of parts I use quite often during projects. So, if you think that I'm missing something important or that you recommend a part to me, you can always sugest them in the issue tracker. Otherwise, if you respect my sorting system you can also create pull requests!
