# KiCad KookieLibs (tm)
(But not really a trademark)

My personal libraries of KiCad symbols, footprints and what not. Most of them are sorted by type (so far utils and logic). Some weird things are in project specific libraries. But you shouldn't use those.

Anything that's marked as a "kookie_*" lib are well maintained schematics and footprints.
Check the wiki for part lists to associate with some of the footprints.

The symbols library is also hosted <HERE> and contains cool symbols to put on your PCB that I created during my projects.

### Utils
 - LED's
 - RGB LED's
 - Switches

### SOC
 - TI BLE 8bit chip (find exact part number here)


### Symbols
