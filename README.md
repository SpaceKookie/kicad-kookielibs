# KiCad KookieLibs (tm)
(But not really a trademark)

My personal libraries of kicad symbols, footprints and what not.

The symbols are sorted by the following categories:

    - MCU (Microcontrollers, Embedded chips, etc.)
    - power (Voltage Regs, Current sources, battery chargers, amplifiers,
      etc.)
    - symbols (PCB Symbols)
    - logic (Low level logic chips. Shift registers, etc.)
    - utils (LEDs, buttons, switches, sockets, etc.)

All libraries start with the "kookie_" prefix. They are well maintained. Everything with a different prefix is either legacy or very project specific stuff and thus not well maintained.

The symbols library is also hosted <HERE> and contains cool symbols to put on your PCB that I created during my projects.

### Utils
 - LED's
 - RGB LED's
 - Switches

### SOC
 - TI BLE 8bit chip (find exact part number here)


### Symbols
 - 3x Bluetooth logo
